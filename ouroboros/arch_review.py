"""
Ouroboros — Daily Architecture Review Rotation.

Tracks which module was last reviewed and schedules the next review automatically.
The user asked for incremental daily reviews: one block per day, rotating through
all modules in a cycle.

Blocks (6 total, one per day):
  0 → agent.py + loop.py        (orchestration & execution engine)
  1 → context.py + llm.py       (context building & LLM client)
  2 → tools/ directory           (tool plugin system)
  3 → memory.py + consciousness.py (memory & background loop)
  4 → supervisor/ directory      (telegram, state, events, queue, workers)
  5 → review.py + arch_review.py + metrics (code quality & review system)
